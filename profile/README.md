**This is a chronicle of the lives of my former classmates from Landmark University and the cool things they’re doing after graduation. Your daily reminder that life moves fast. You’re welcome.**

My circle leans heavily towards those in tech and other interesting fields. Most of them are going to do big things. You’ll read about them here first.
